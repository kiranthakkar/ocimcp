# Overview
The OCI IAM MCP Server is a tool that enables AI models to interact directly with your OCI IAM environment using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Built specifically for IAM engineers, security teams, and OCI administrators, it implements the MCP specification to transform how AI assistants can help manage and analyze OCI IAM resources.

To learn more about MCP, [Refer to Go fastmcp documentation.](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome)

# Available Tools

OCI IAM MCP server currently supports following tools:

**User Management**

- Search Users
- Get User by ID or Name
- Create User

This the very first version of OCI IAM MCP server. I will add more tools in the MCP server. This can be extended to support MCP servers for other OCI services as well.

# QuickStart

**Pre Requisites**

- Python 3.13 or later version
- oci cli 
- An MCP compatible AI client or you can test MCP server using Interpreter as well

**Installation**

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kiranthakkar/ocimcp.git
